1. The output of the code snippet is undefined. It invokes undefined behavior due to multiple modifications and lack of sequence points in the expression.
2. Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. Example:
#include <stdio.h>
int factorial(int n) {
if (n == 0)
return 1;
else
return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
int main() {
int num = 5;
int result = factorial(num);
printf("Factorial of %d is %d", num, result);
return 0;
}
3. The volatile keyword is used to indicate that a variable may be modified by external entities, preventing certain optimizations by the compiler.
4. A structure in C is a collection of different data types grouped together, while a union is a data type that can hold variables of different types, but only one member can be accessed at a time.
5. The const keyword in C is used to declare a variable as read-only, meaning its value cannot be modified. When used with pointer variables, it ensures that the pointer itself cannot be used to modify the value it points to.
6. Here's a code snippet to reverse a linked list in C:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
typedef struct Node {
int data;
struct Node* next;
} Node;
void reverseLinkedList(Node** head) {
Node* prev = NULL;
Node* current = *head;
Node* next = NULL;
while (current != NULL) {
next = current->next;
current->next = prev;
prev = current;
current = next;
}
*head = prev;
}
int main() {
Node* head = NULL;
// Linked list creation and insertion code goes here...
reverseLinkedList(&head);
// Print the reversed linked list...
return 0;
}
7. Function pointers in C are variables that store the memory address of a function. They can be used to dynamically select and invoke functions at runtime. Example:
#include <stdio.h>
void add(int a, int b) {
printf("Sum: %d", a + b);
}
void subtract(int a, int b) {
printf("Difference: %d", a - b);
}
int main() {
void (*funcPtr)(int, int);
int choice = 1;
if (choice == 1)
funcPtr = add;
else
funcPtr = subtract;
funcPtr(5, 3); // Invokes the selected function
return 0;
}
8. The output of the code snippet is undefined. It invokes undefined behavior by accessing memory beyond the array boundaries, leading to unpredictable results.
